**A secure, private, and elegant period tracking app — yours and yours only.**  
No servers. No accounts. No subscriptions. Just you and your cycle.

## What is Hera?

**Hera** is a privacy-first period tracker inspired by lunar cycles and Greek mythology.  
It’s built entirely around your safety, security, and sovereignty.

- **No 3rd-party servers**
- **No accounts or cloud sync**
- **No ads, tracking, or analytics**
- **No subscriptions**
- **No corporate surveillance**

In a time when your most intimate data can be sold, hacked, or even subpoenaed, Hera offers a radical alternative:

> _“It’s yours and yours only.”_

## Why not other apps?

Many popular cycle trackers **claim** to protect your privacy —  
but quietly sell your data to advertisers, governments, or worse.

Some users now create **multiple accounts** to hide their data from authorities.  
Some apps **obfuscate** what they collect — but they **still collect**.

We believe this is wrong. You shouldn’t have to hide from your own tools.

## Why Hera Exists

- Because **privacy** isn’t optional.
- Because you shouldn’t need to trust — only verify.
- Because **reproductive health** should not be monetized.
- Because **safety** means **total control** — not fake toggles.

## Development Status

> **Hera is currently in active development.**  
Core features are being built.


## Philosophy

> **No security through obscurity. No clutter. No compromises.**

- Hera does not *look* secure — it **is** secure.
- No hidden exports. No false privacy settings. No opt-ins.  
- If it’s not **on your device**, it doesn’t exist.

Privacy isn't a feature. It’s a **foundation**.

Hera is the Greek goddess of women, fertility, sovereignty, and life itself.
She symbolizes dignity, protection, and divine ownership — just like this app.
